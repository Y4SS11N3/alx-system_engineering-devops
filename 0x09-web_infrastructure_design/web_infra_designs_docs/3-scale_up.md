# Scale Up: Enhancing Web Infrastructure for www.foobar.com

This document details an advanced web infrastructure setup for www.foobar.com, designed to further enhance scalability, reliability, and performance by scaling up the existing architecture.

## Overview

To accommodate increased traffic and ensure high availability, the web infrastructure undergoes a significant expansion, including the addition of another server and a load balancer, as well as the separation of components across dedicated servers.

## Enhancements

### Added Components

#### Additional Server

- **Purpose**: Increases the infrastructure's capacity by hosting either a web server, an application server, or a database, thereby enhancing the overall performance and reliability of the web service.
- **Why Added**: To distribute the load more evenly and ensure that each component can operate optimally without being affected by the load on other components.

#### Load Balancer (HAproxy) Configured as a Cluster

- **Purpose**: Improves fault tolerance and load distribution by clustering load balancers, ensuring uninterrupted service even if one load balancer fails.
- **Why Added**: To provide redundancy for the load balancing component of the infrastructure, ensuring that there is no single point of failure in directing traffic to web servers.

### Split Components Across Servers

#### Dedicated Web Server

- **Purpose**: Hosts only the Nginx web server, optimized for handling HTTP/HTTPS requests efficiently.
- **Why**: To ensure that static content is served quickly and efficiently, without the overhead of running other types of software on the same server.

#### Dedicated Application Server

- **Purpose**: Runs the application code in an isolated environment, separate from the web server and database.
- **Why**: To allow for better resource allocation and scaling of the application layer independently from the rest of the infrastructure.

#### Dedicated Database Server

- **Purpose**: Hosts the MySQL database, providing storage and retrieval of data in a manner optimized for high availability and performance.
- **Why**: To isolate database operations from application logic, ensuring data integrity and performance even under heavy load.

## Specifics About the Infrastructure Enhancements

### Every Additional Element

The introduction of an additional server, the clustering of load balancers, and the separation of components into dedicated servers are strategic decisions aimed at scaling the infrastructure to handle increased demand more effectively. These enhancements are designed to improve the web service's scalability, reliability, and performance by distributing the load across more resources and minimizing the impact of any single component's failure on the overall system.
