# Postmortem Report: The Case of the Uncooperative Admin Panel

Author: [Yassine Mtejjal]

## Issue Summary
On a fateful Monday morning, August 14, 2023, our dear admin panel decided to take an unauthorized vacation from 09:15 EST to 11:45 EST. During this rebellious escapade, the panel completely shut its doors to all admin users, rudely presenting them with a "401 Unauthorized" error message.

This sudden strike affected 100% of our admin user base, leaving them locked out and scratching their heads in confusion. After a thorough investigation, it was discovered that a mischievous misconfiguration in the authentication middleware, which snuck in during a recent deployment, was the culprit behind this chaos.

## Timeline

| Time (EST) | Event |
|------------|-------|
| 09:15 | The monitoring system sounded the alarm, reporting a suspicious spike in 401 errors on the admin panel login page 🚨 |
| 09:20 | Confirmed that admin users were indeed facing a "no entry" situation 🚫 |
| 09:30 | Donned the detective hat and began examining the authentication service and recent code changes for clues 🔍 |
| 09:45 | Stumbled upon a peculiar modification in the authentication middleware configuration 🧐 |
| 10:00 | Aha! Identified the sneaky misconfiguration that caused the authentication process to go haywire 💡 |
| 10:30 | Crafted and tested a fix to bring order back to the middleware kingdom 🛠️ |
| 11:00 | Deployed the fix to the production realm, hoping to restore peace ✨ |
| 11:15 | Victory! Admin users were finally able to log in and resume their duties 🎉 |
| 11:45 | Monitoring confirmed that the authentication errors had vanished, signaling the end of the crisis 😌 |

## Root Cause and Resolution
After an intensive investigation, it was revealed that a single missing parameter in the authentication middleware configuration was the root of all evil. This tiny omission, accidentally introduced during a recent deployment, wreaked havoc on the entire authentication process. Without this crucial parameter, the middleware treated every incoming request as an unwelcome guest, ruthlessly denying them access with a 401 error.

To restore harmony, the missing parameter was carefully added back to the middleware configuration file, like a missing puzzle piece. The updated configuration underwent rigorous testing in a staging environment to ensure it played nicely with the authentication process. Once given the green light, the fix was deployed to the production environment, finally granting admin users the access they deserved.

## Corrective and Preventive Measures
To prevent such mischief from recurring, the following measures have been prescribed:

| Measure | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| 1. Superhero-level code review process | Catch configuration errors before they can cause trouble 🦸‍♂️ |
| 2. Army of automated tests | Keep the authentication middleware in check 🤖 |
| 3. Vigilant monitoring and alerting system | Become a watchdog for authentication issues 🐶 |
| 4. Sacred tome of documentation | Serve as a guiding light for future generations 📜 |

To implement these measures and save the day, the following tasks have been prioritized:

- [ ] Update the code review checklist to include a keen eye for configuration files
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests to keep the authentication middleware on its best behavior
- [ ] Integrate additional monitoring checks to detect any authentication-related misbehavior
- [ ] Document the authentication middleware configuration with the utmost clarity and detail

With these steps, we shall ensure that the admin panel remains a loyal and cooperative member of our application family. 🤝
