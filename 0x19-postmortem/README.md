# Postmortem Report: Admin Panel Authentication Outage

Date: August 14, 2023
Author: [Yassine Mtejjjal]

## Issue Summary
On August 14, 2023, from 09:15 EST to 11:45 EST, the admin panel of the application experienced a critical authentication issue, preventing all admin users from logging in and accessing the system. The outage lasted for 2 hours and 30 minutes, affecting 100% of the admin user base. During this period, admin users encountered a "401 Unauthorized" error message when attempting to log in. The root cause was identified as a misconfiguration in the authentication middleware that occurred during a recent deployment.

## Timeline
- 09:15 EST - Received an alert from the monitoring system indicating a high number of 401 Unauthorized errors on the admin panel login page
- 09:20 EST - Verified that no admin users were able to log in successfully
- 09:30 EST - Began investigating the authentication service and reviewing recent code changes
- 09:45 EST - Discovered a suspicious modification in the authentication middleware configuration
- 10:00 EST - Identified the misconfiguration in the middleware that caused the authentication process to fail
- 10:30 EST - Developed and tested a fix for the middleware issue
- 11:00 EST - Deployed the fix to the production environment
- 11:15 EST - Verified that admin users were able to log in successfully
- 11:45 EST - Monitoring showed no further authentication errors, confirming the resolution of the issue

## Root Cause and Resolution
The root cause of the authentication outage was a misconfiguration in the authentication middleware. The recent deployment included an update to the middleware configuration file, where a critical parameter was accidentally removed. This parameter was essential for correctly validating and processing the authentication tokens. Without it, the middleware treated all incoming requests as unauthorized, resulting in the 401 error.

To resolve the issue, the missing parameter was added back to the middleware configuration file. The updated configuration was thoroughly tested in a staging environment to ensure the correct functionality of the authentication process. Once validated, the fix was deployed to the production environment, restoring access to the admin panel for all admin users.

## Corrective and Preventive Measures
To prevent similar issues from occurring in the future, the following measures will be implemented:

1. Implement a more robust code review process to catch configuration errors before deployment.
2. Add automated tests specifically for the authentication middleware to ensure its proper functionality.
3. Improve the monitoring and alerting system to detect authentication issues more quickly.
4. Create detailed documentation for the authentication middleware configuration to serve as a reference.

To address the identified areas of improvement, the following tasks will be prioritized:

- [ ] Update the code review checklist to include a focus on configuration files
- [ ] Write comprehensive unit tests for the authentication middleware
- [ ] Integrate additional monitoring checks for authentication-related errors
- [ ] Document the authentication middleware configuration thoroughly, including all critical parameters and their purposes
